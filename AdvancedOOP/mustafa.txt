During Suleiman Persian campaign his army halted in Eregli for a while. 
While Suleiman army was in Eregli, Rustem Pasha made an offer to Mustafa to join his father army. 
At the same time he warned Suleiman and persuaded him that Mustafa was coming to kill him. 

Mustafa accepted Rüstem Pasha’s offer and assembled his army to join his father's. 
Suleiman saw this as a threat and ordered the execution of his son. 
When Mustafa entered his father’s tent to meet with him, Suleiman's guards attacked Mustafa, and after a long struggle they killed him using a bow-string.
